According to legend, the Day of Fire occurred shortly before [[The Silence]]. An [[Ancient Weapons|Ancient Weapon]] was detonated in the south, wiping out the nations of [[Vissias]] and [[Aliant]]. The region was devastated, turned into a barren desert that is now known as [[Dragonsand]].



"_The wrath of heaven poured out of the artifact, instantly slaying both armies to a man and filling the land with poison. Fire rained onto the town of [[Aliant]], burned the green fields of [[Vissias]], and wrought ruin for hundreds of miles around. Uninhabitable for centuries, the formerly lush lands of [[Vissias]] and [[Aliant]] became the vast desert known now as [[Dragonsand]]
