According to legend, during the [[Time of Wonders]], the great Heavenly Forges were able to create wondrous constructions, from advanced [[Ancient Weapons]] to powerful artifacts. After [[The Silence]], the Forges broke down and were scrapped for parts. None remain in operation for at least 1000 years.
