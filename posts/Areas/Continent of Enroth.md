The Continent of Enroth is one of three known Continents on the [[Enroth (World)|World]] of the same name. When the world was first settled, the settlers knew nothing about other continents, naming theirs Enroth. After other continents were discovered, the name stuck, both to the [[Enroth (World)|World]] and the continent.

The Continent lies on the northern hemisphere, with the very cold [[Frozen Highlands]] leading into unhospitable Ice Plains in the north, and the hot deserts of [[Hermit's Isle]] and [[Dragonsand]] to the south.

The eastern part is cooled more by the ocean, making the south-lying regions of [[Darkmoor Region|Darkmoor]], [[Ironfist Region|Ironfist]] and [[New Sorpigal Region|New Sorpigal]] much more habitable than the western wastes. The east of the Continent consists of a large archipelago, encompassing [[Bootleg Bay]], the [[Misty Islands]] and the [[Eel-Infested Waters]].

The Continent is mostly controlled by the [[Kingdom of Enroth|Kingdom of Enroth]] under the rule of the [[Ironfist Dynasty]]. Some pockets of barbarism remain, as well as plenty of [[Bandits]] and [[Gangs]] operating outside of the [[Ironfist Dynasty|Ironfist]] jurisdiction.
