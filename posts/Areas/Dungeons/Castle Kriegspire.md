Castle Kriegspire, at one time, was the center of magical experimentation in creating creatures. Now, it's abandoned and the creatures run rampant inside. The volcano it rests in was created to keep all the monsters in.

The Castle is located in the prominent Volcano within the [[Kriegspire Region|Region of Kriegspire]].
