Icewind Keep is a grand Keep guarding [[Icewind Pass]], a Mountain Pass in the [[Frozen Highlands]] connecting the [[Town of Whitecap]] to the [[City of Free Haven]] and the rest of the [[Kingdom of Enroth|Kingdom]] beyond.

The Villagers of [[Town of Whitecap|Whitecap]] are severely troubled by the fall of the Keep. If no caravans can pass through the [[Icewind Pass|Pass]], the [[Town of Whitecap|Town]] is surely doomed.
