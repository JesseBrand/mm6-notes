Icewind Pass is a Mountain Pass through the [[Frozen Highlands]]. The road between the [[City of Free Haven]] and the [[Town of Whitecap]] leads through it.

It is guarded by [[Icewind Keep]], which has recently been overrun by [[Ogres]], making travel through the pass treacherous.

The Villagers of [[Town of Whitecap|Whitecap]] are severely troubled by the fall of the [[Icewind Keep|Keep]]. If no caravans can pass through the pass, the [[Town of Whitecap|Town]] is surely doomed.
