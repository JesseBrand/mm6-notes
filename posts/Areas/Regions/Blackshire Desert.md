The Blackshire Desert lies to the south of [[Blackshire Region|Blackshire]] and is separated from it by a large mountain range, which keeps the dangers from the desert and [[Dragonsand]] beyond away from the more civilized areas. [[Paradise Valley]] can be reached to the west while [[Darkmoor Region|Darkmoor]] lies behind the mountain range to the east.
