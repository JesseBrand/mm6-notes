Bootleg Bay is situated on the eastern shores of the [[Continent of Enroth]]. It consists of a small strip of mainland, along with many islands located in the bay. The bay extends towards the ocean to the east, with the [[Misty Islands]] archipelago laying in between. The bay intersects the [[Eel-Infested Waters]] to the northeast and is contained by [[Free Haven Region|Free Haven]] to the west and [[Silver Cove Region|Silver Cove]] to the north. The [[Ironfist Region]] lies to the south

The southern parts are home to tribes of [[Cannibals]], forming a great danger to travelers in the area.

The islands are home to tribes of [[Cannibals]], as well as [[Lizardfolk]]. Travelers are discouraged from traveling the Bay unprepared.

The [[The Bootleg Boys|Bootleg Boys]] are a criminal gang that consider the region their territory. Their conflicts with other [[Gangs]] wreak havoc on the region. The [[Royal Army]] and [[Royal Navy]] are generally too engaged to chase down these minor nuisances, leaving the region to fend for themselves.
