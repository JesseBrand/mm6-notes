The Eel-Infested Waters are a highly dangerous archipelago of islands located at the northeastern shores of the [[Continent of Enroth]], north of the [[Misty Islands]] and east of [[Silver Cove Region|Silver Cove]].

Only few captains venture into this dangerous area, which is plagued by [[Sea Serpents]].

The large northern island is relatively peaceful, with the [[Village of Alamos]] being policed by [[Magyar]] who have made [[Castle Alamos]] their base. The southern island is more lawless and home to many dangers.

The Eel-Infested Waters have an ongoing [[Gangs|Gang]] problem with the [[Wealthy Eels]] working out of the [[Village of Alamos]]. The conflicts between them and other [[Gangs]] lead to frequent violence.
