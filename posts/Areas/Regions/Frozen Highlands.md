The Frozen Highlands are an area of extreme cold located at the northern reaches of the [[Continent of Enroth|Continent of Enroth]]. To the north, the barren snow-covered plains stretch into infinity. A mountain range divides it in two, from the south to the northeast. [[Castle Stone]] and the [[Town of Hargraeve]] lies to the southeast of it, along the road between [[Free Haven Region|Free Haven]] to the south and [[Silver Cove Region|Silver Cove]] to the east. To the west, the [[Kriegspire Wastes]] lie, with [[Kriegspire Region|Kriegspire]] proper located south of a distinctive mountain range.

The [[Town of Whitecap]] and [[Castle Stromgard]] are located to the north of the mountains. [[Icewind Keep]] is located to the west. The keep used to guard the [[Icewind Pass]], but was lost to [[Ogres]] in recent years, making travel to and from the [[City of Free Haven]] perilous.
