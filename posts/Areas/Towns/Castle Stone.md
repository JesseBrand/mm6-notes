Castle Stone is the Seat of Power of [[Anthony Stone|Lord Anthony Stone]]. It is located in the [[Town of Hargraeve]] in the [[Frozen Highlands]].

Castle Stone is well-fortified and perfectly able to deal with incursions of the [[Magyar]] forces and [[Harpies]] in the area, but cannot project its power further than its direct vicinity.
