Ironfist Village is located right underneath [[Castle Ironfist]] in the [[Ironfist Region]], being shielded by it from attacks from land or sea.

It is a main hub of commerce, with a great dock connecting it to [[Bootleg Bay]] to the east, though the threat of [[Piracy]] is ever present. The [[Royal Navy]] uses it as one of its perches.
