The Island of Mist is a main island surrounded by a [[Misty Islands|Minor Archipelago]].

It is located to the north of [[New Sorpigal North Island]], and to the east of [[Bootleg Bay]]. Further north lie the dangerous [[Eel-Infested Waters]]

Mist was originally intended to be a customs and trading port for dealings with the Eastern islands and [[Antagarich|Countries]]. [[Piracy]] has severely cut into that trade, so it's not as prosperous as it should be.

Mist supported [[Roland Ironfist]] in the [[War of Enrothian Succession]]
