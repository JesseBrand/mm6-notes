The [[Towns of Enroth|Village]] of Pontsbury is located among the many island in [[Bootleg Bay]]. It is only reachable by [[Ships|Ship]], being disconnected from the mainland.

The [[Towns of Enroth|Village]] sustained heavy damage with severe casualties in recent years after a power struggle between the rival [[Gangs]] of the [[Bootleg Bay]] and the [[Wealthy Eels]] operating out of [[City of Silver Cove|Silver Cove]]. After the local [[Temples]] was burned down, vile forces took hold of the remains, scaring the villagers away from it.

Some reconstruction efforts have been initiated recently, under the watchful eye of the [[Bootleg Militia]].
