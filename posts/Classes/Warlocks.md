Warlocks are spellcasters, deriving their powers from a [[Patrons|Patron]] with whom they have made a [[Pact]].

In the [[Kingdom of Enroth]] they are looked upon with distrust. Most Warlocks, among which the powerful magician [[Agar]] were in league with [[Archibald Ironfist]] during the [[War of Enrothian Succession]] and were subsequently imprisoned, banished, or stripped of their possessions.

Fledging Warlocks are known as [[Occultists]]. It is unknown who the current authority on the promotion of [[Occultists]] to [[Warlocks]], and [[Warlocks]] to [[Grand Warlocks]] is.
