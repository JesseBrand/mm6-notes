The Night of Shooting Stars was a major event on the [[Enroth (World)|World of Enroth]]. In the middle of the night, many meteorites crashed down onto the surface of the [[Continent of Enroth]], as well as [[Antagarich]].

Soon after, troubles started spreading throughout the [[Kingdom of Enroth|Kingdom]]. Foul creatures left their hiding places, crops failed and travel became far more dangerous.
