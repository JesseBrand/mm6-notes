The Rabidity of Dragons is the name given by the [[Humans]] of [[Kingdom of Enroth|Enroth]] to the degradation of [[Dragons]] from supreme intelligence to the rabid state they are in today.

After [[The Silence]], the [[Dragons]] slowly lost all sense of intelligence and wisdom and degenerated into rabid, animalistic creatures.
