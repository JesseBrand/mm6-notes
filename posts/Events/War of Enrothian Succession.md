After the death of [[Morglin Ironfist]], he left two sons, [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] and [[Archibald Ironfist|Archibald]]. By tradition, the choice of who would be the next king was up to the [[Royal Seer]]. Unfortunately, the [[Royal Seer|Seer]] died in a boating accident, his replacement fell out of a castle window, his replacement was killed by a [[Dragons|Dragon]], and his replacement died of food poisoning. [[Archibald Ironfist|Archibald]] used these coincidental deaths to his advantage, and accused [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] of murdering them all. [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] abandoned his castle and went into hiding, where he would eventually declare war against his brother.

With [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] out of his way, [[Archibald Ironfist|Archibald]] had a chance to "influence" (bribe) the new [[Royal Seer]]. The [[Royal Seer|Seer]] crowned [[Archibald Ironfist|Archibald]] King, and he began a reign of terror in [[Kingdom of Enroth|Enroth]]. Three years later, [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] declared war. [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] was eventually able to best his brother, having his Court Mage [[Tanir]] turn [[Archibald Ironfist|Archibald]] to stone and placing him in the [[Royal Library]] in [[Castle Ironfist]].
