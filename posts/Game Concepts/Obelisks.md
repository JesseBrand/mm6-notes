Strange Obelisks are located throughout the regions of [[Continent of Enroth|Enroth]]. The population tends to stay away from these, as not everyone who investigates them returns. [[Mages]] of several kind have investigated the Obelisks, some claiming to have uncovered cryptic messages, but none have cracked their meaning.
