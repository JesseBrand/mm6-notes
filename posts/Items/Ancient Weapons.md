Legend tells of powerful weapons of [[The Ancients]] that were supposed to be so powerful they could level armies and the strongest of monsters within seconds, as well as cause major destruction, laying entire regions to waste. They were supposedly forged in the [[Heavenly Forges]] before [[The Silence]].

According to legend, [[Dragonsand]] was once a green and fertile place, until an Ancient Weapon was detonated during the [[Day of Fire]], turning it into a barren wasteland.
