This page will list all rules maintained for the campaign.
## General Rules
* Rule #1: The DM always has the last say in applied rules.
* The general sense of these maintained rules is to make the game fun for everyone, keep excessive administration to a minimum, but keep the game balanced between PCs and NPCs, as well as maintaining some degree of realism (in a high-fantasy setting)
* In general, Sage Advice is used in determining how to apply rules, especially Rules as Intended (RaI)
* It is encouraged for players to assist in calls, indicating where to find rules, but defer to Rule #1 above.
## Variant Rules
### Several
* Variant races: yes
### PHB
* Feats: yes (including all [[Allowed Materials]])
* Encumbrance: yes, but in broad lines. No need to maintain exact weight lists. However, the DM may rule that a character is encumbered or heavily encumbered if it carries too much. This is especially relevant for mounts that may not be able to carry fully armored characters and their loot. The use of coaches and wagons is encouraged.
* Equipment size: yes, but limited. Smiths will be able to help here
* Cover: yes, including potentially destroying cover
* Inspiration: yes, regularly
* Multiclassing: yes
* Skills with Different Abilities: yes
### DMG
* Spell Points: yes! For all classes except warlocks.
* Climbing onto bigger creature: yes
* Disarm: no
* Flanking: no
* Mark: no
* Overrun: no
* Shove aside: yes
* Tumble (pass through opponents space): yes
* Cleaving: no, but possibly debatable
* Firearms, explosives, alien technology: no starting skills. Introduction left at the discretion of the DM
* Fear and Horror: potentially limited, but most likely no
* Healer's Kit Dependency: potentially, discuss in [[Session 0]]
* Healing Surges: no
* Hero Point: potentially
* Honour: no
* Initiative Variants: no

* Milestone Experience: yes, paced and balanced by DM, to be discussed in [[Session 0]]
* Loyalty: yes, for NPC hirelings, in limited form
* Massive Damage: no
* Mixing Potions: yes, the Might & Magic setting heavily includes alchemy & potions, so this may work very well
* Morale: no, not following these rules. NPCs will still generally act according to natural instinct and self-preservation.
* More Difficult Item Identification: yes, you need the Identify spell to identify an item. Taking an item will not work. [[Stores|Shopkeepers]] can also identify items for a price.
* Players Award Inspiration: no
* Piety: no
* Planar Effects: Potentially, DMs discretion
* Plot Points: no, but the DM takes the backgrounds and experiences of the characters into account while shaping the world. Players are encouraged to provide a rich background, and contact the DM between sessions on specific character hooks.
* Proficiency Check Variants: no
* Proficiency Dice: no, while interesting, this would slow down the game too much
* Renown: yes, in a sense
* Rest Variants: no, 1 hour for short rest, 8 hours for long rest (exceptions apply)
* Madness: yes
* Sanity: no
* Scroll Mishaps: potentially, discuss in [[Session 0]]
