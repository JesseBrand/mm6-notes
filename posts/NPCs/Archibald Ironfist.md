After the death of their father [[Morglin Ironfist]], a [[War of Enrothian Succession|Succession War]] broke out between [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] and Archibald, leading to major strife in the realm. [[Roland Ironfist|Roland]] was eventually able to win, having [[Tanir]] put Archibald to stone.

His stone statue currently stands in the [[Royal Library]] in [[Castle Ironfist]].
